## Beginning a Career
In 2013 after graduating from university, I started work as a Software Engineer at Aerojet Rocketdyne. I was initially assigned to the [RS-25 rocket engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25) program which I supported for my entire 5 year stay. During my time at AR I supported the full lifecycle of software development for a wide variety of applications.

While working at AR I frequently travelled to multiple NASA locations like Kennedy Space Center and Stennis Space Center. I also supported projects at multiple Aerojet Rocketdyne locations coast to coast.

My time at Aerojet Rocketdyne ended in 2018 when I accepted a new position at Pinnacle Solutions, Inc.
