## Serious Simulations
In 2018 I was given the opportunity to join Pinnacle Solutions as a Senior Software Developer to work on Air Force training simulators and almost immediately I was travelling to Travis and McGuire Air Force Bases to develop, integrate, and verify simulation control software.

After completing the KC-10 training simulators I was assigned to the UH-60 Virtual Maintenance Trainer (VMT), a commercial product designed and sold by Pinnacle to train ground crews to perform full mechanical and airframe maintenance to the aircraft.

The VMT was developed in Unity Engine and provided a full 3D interactive representation of the vehicle, including breakaways and disassemblies for all major maintenance tasks.

After a successful year at the company I decided to part ways with Pinnacle Solutions in 2019. The decision to leave came at the conclusion of my role prior to transferring to a new assignment.
