## Serious Simulations
In 2018 when my time at Rocketdyne was coming to a close I was given the opportunity to join Pinnacle Solutions as a Senior Software Developer to work on Air Force training simulators.

Almost immediately I was travelling to Travis and McGuire Air Force Bases to integrate and verify our updated software.

After a successful year at the company I decided to part ways with Pinnacle Solutions in 2019. The decision to leave came at the conclusion of my role prior to transferring to a new assignment.
