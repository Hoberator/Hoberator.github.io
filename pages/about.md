Hi, I'm Kyle Knapp, a Software Engineer in Huntsville, Alabama. My areas of expertise are in Simulation and Real-time Data Acquisition and Control Software. Ever since my degree in 2013 I have actively programmed as a career and hobby. I've recently taken an interest in Serious Games and Unreal Engine to the point that I have developed my own flight simulator.

You can learn more about me by checking out posts in my portfolio or viewing my resume.
