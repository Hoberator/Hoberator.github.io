Hi, I'm Kyle Knapp, a Software Engineer in Huntsville, Alabama. My areas of expertise are in Simulation and Real-time Data Acquisition and Control Software. Ever since I've earned my degree in 2013 I have actively programmed as a career and hobby. I've recently taken an interest in Serious Games and Unreal Engine to the point that I've developed my own flight simulator.
